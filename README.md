# Pong Read Me 

### Usage


1. General Rules
> This is a very simplistic version of pong with only one rule...
> Whats the rule? Do not allow the ball to touch the board, so if the ball moves past your paddle = game over.
> To do this you are going to move your paddle up and down to deflect the ball back at the opponent.
> Your opponent is an "AI" player that is quite challenging some might consider impossible to beat.
2. How to play 
> 1. Run the game.
> 2. Press enter whenever you dare to begin the game. 
> 3. Now it is up to you to press either the UP or DOWN arrow to move your paddle respectivly. Remember the goal is to deflect the ball back at the computer, so move up or down accordingly.

3. Play around!
> In the board_inputs.txt file you can change the height and or width of the board. Line on is the width and line two is the height.
